# Music_Database
Music DataBase Creation:

- Create a new database called music_db
- Create three tables: Artists, Albums, and Songs.
- The Artists table stores artist names.
- The Albums table stores album titles, release years, and references the artist ID from the Artists table.
- The Songs table stores song titles, durations, and references the album ID from the Albums table.
- Insert sample data into the tables.
